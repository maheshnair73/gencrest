# Multi-Select Filters Implementation

## Overview
Implemented multi-select filters for the Reports page with conditional "Generate" button and download controls.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Select Filters
Users can now select multiple items for filtering:
- **Zones**: Select multiple zones to filter data
- **Regions**: Select multiple regions
- **Territories**: Select multiple territories  
- **Products**: Select multiple products/SKUs
- **Customers (Outlets)**: Select specific customers to include in report

### 2. Generate Button Logic
- **Button Label**: Changed from "Refresh" to "Generate" with Play icon
- **Activation**: Only enabled when at least one filter is selected
- **Visual State**: 
  - Enabled: Blue background with hover effect
  - Disabled: Gray background, cursor not-allowed

### 3. Download Controls
All download/share buttons (Excel, Email, WhatsApp) are now:
- **Disabled by default** until a report is generated
- **Enabled after Generate** button is clicked
- **Visual feedback**: Gray when disabled, colored when enabled

### 4. UI Components
- Using **React Select** library for multi-select dropdowns
- Clean, modern interface with labels
- Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2-3 columns desktop)
- "Clear All Filters" button appears when any filter is active

## User Flow

```
1. User selects filters (zones, regions, products, etc.)
   ↓
2. "Generate" button becomes enabled (blue)
   ↓
3. User clicks "Generate"
   ↓
4. Report data is fetched and filtered
   ↓
5. Download buttons become enabled (Excel, Email, WhatsApp)
   ↓
6. User can download or share the filtered report
```

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [selectedZones, setSelectedZones] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [selectedRegions, setSelectedRegions] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [selectedTerritories, setSelectedTerritories] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [selectedProducts, setSelectedProducts] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [selectedOutlets, setSelectedOutlets] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [reportGenerated, setReportGenerated] = useState(false);
```

### Filter Logic
Filters are applied using array methods:
- `filter()` with `includes()` for zone/region/territory matching
- `some()` for multi-criteria product matching
- `map()` and nested `filter()` for outlet-level filtering

### Button States
```typescript
// Generate button
disabled={!hasFiltersSelected}

// Download buttons  
disabled={!reportGenerated}
```

## Benefits

1. **Flexible Reporting**: Generate reports for specific combinations of data
2. **Better UX**: Clear visual feedback on what's selectable/clickable
3. **Prevents Empty Reports**: Generate button only works with filters
4. **Prevents Premature Downloads**: Can't download until report is generated
5. **Easy to Clear**: One-click clear all filters button

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Regional Analysis
- Select "North Zone" and "South Zone" from Zones
- Select "Product A" and "Product B" from Products
- Click "Generate"
- Download Excel report with only those zones and products

### Use Case 2: Customer-Specific Report
- Switch to "Customer-wise" view
- Select specific customers: "Store A", "Store B", "Store C"
- Click "Generate"
- Email report to stakeholders with only selected customers

### Use Case 3: Territory Performance
- Select multiple territories
- Generate report
- Compare performance across selected territories only

## Files Modified
- `/src/pages/Reports.tsx` - Main implementation
- Added React Select for multi-select UI
- Updated filter logic for array-based filtering
- Modified button states and styling
