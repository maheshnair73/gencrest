# Stock Transfer and Retailer Inventory Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a complete system for tracking stock movements from distributors to retailers and maintaining accurate retailer inventory levels. This solves the critical business requirement where stock transfers must be fully traceable and retailer inventories must be updated automatically.

## Problem Statement
Previously, when a distributor transferred stock to retailers (e.g., 10 units to Mahesh Enterprises, 7 units to Sanal Enterprises), the system only tracked the distributor's stock reduction but did not:
- Record the transfer transaction
- Update retailer inventory
- Provide any audit trail or history
- Allow MDOs to verify retailer stock levels

## Solution Components

### 1. Database Schema

#### `stock_transfers` Table
Tracks every stock movement in the supply chain:
- From distributor to retailer
- From distributor to farmer
- Retailer returns
- Retailer to farmer sales

**Key Fields:**
- Transfer details (type, date, quantity, value)
- Source entity (distributor/retailer ID and name)
- Destination entity (retailer/farmer ID and name)
- Product and SKU information
- GPS coordinates for verification
- Who recorded the transfer

**Location:** `supabase/migrations/create_stock_transfers_and_retailer_inventory.sql`

#### `retailer_inventory` Table
Maintains current stock levels for each retailer by SKU:
- Current stock quantity
- Total received (lifetime)
- Total sold (lifetime)
- Last received date and quantity
- Associated distributor information

**Unique Constraint:** (retailer_id, product_code, sku_code)

### 2. Stock Transfer Service

**File:** `src/utils/stockTransferService.ts`

**Key Functions:**
- `recordStockTransfer()` - Creates immutable transfer records
- `updateRetailerInventory()` - Updates or creates retailer inventory records
- `recordRetailerToFarmerSale()` - Tracks retailer liquidations
- `getRetailerInventory()` - Retrieves current retailer stock levels
- `getStockTransferHistory()` - Gets complete transfer history
- `getDistributorToRetailerTransfers()` - Distributor-specific transfers
- `getRetailerReceivedStock()` - Retailer-specific receipts

### 3. Integration with Liquidation Flow

**File:** `src/pages/Liquidation.tsx` (lines 3067-3204)

When a distributor updates stock and transfers to retailers:

1. **Geofence Validation** - Ensures MDO is at the physical location
2. **For Each Retailer:**
   - Creates stock transfer record in database
   - Updates retailer inventory (adds quantity)
   - Records GPS coordinates
   - Captures who made the transfer
3. **For Each Farmer Sale:**
   - Creates stock transfer record
   - Tracks liquidation separately from retailer transfers
4. **Local State Update** - Updates distributor's stock in UI

**Example Flow:**
```
Distributor Stock: 217 → 200 (reduced by 17)
├─ 10 units → Mahesh Enterprises (recorded + inventory updated)
└─ 7 units → Sanal Enterprises (recorded + inventory updated)
```

### 4. Retailer Inventory View

**File:** `src/pages/RetailerInventory.tsx`
**Route:** `/retailer-inventory?retailerId=XXX&retailerName=XXX`

**Features:**
- **Inventory Tab:** Shows current stock levels by product/SKU
  - Current stock quantity
  - Total received (lifetime)
  - Total sold (lifetime)
  - Last received date/quantity
  - Source distributor

- **Transfer History Tab:** Complete audit trail
  - All stock receipts
  - Transfer dates and quantities
  - Source distributor
  - GPS verification status
  - Who recorded the transfer
  - Transfer values

## Usage Example

### Scenario: Stock Transfer
1. MDO goes to distributor location (GPS verified)
2. Opens Liquidation page → Verify Stock
3. Updates stock from 217 to 200 for SKU "Agrosatva 250ml"
4. System detects 17 unit reduction
5. MDO selects "Transfer to Retailer"
6. Adds retailers:
   - Mahesh Enterprises (Business) - 10 units
   - Sanal Enterprises (Business) - 7 units
7. Confirms transfer

### What Happens in Database:

**stock_transfers table (2 records created):**
```sql
-- Transfer 1
INSERT INTO stock_transfers VALUES (
  transfer_type: 'distributor_to_retailer',
  from_entity_id: 'DIST001',
  from_entity_name: 'ABC Distributors',
  to_entity_id: 'Mahesh Enterprises',
  to_entity_name: 'Mahesh',
  product_code: 'FGCMGM0092',
  sku_code: 'FGCMGM0092-250',
  quantity: 10,
  latitude: 12.9716,
  longitude: 77.5946,
  ...
);

-- Transfer 2
INSERT INTO stock_transfers VALUES (
  ... (similar for Sanal Enterprises, 7 units) ...
);
```

**retailer_inventory table (2 records updated/created):**
```sql
-- Mahesh Enterprises
UPDATE retailer_inventory
SET current_stock = current_stock + 10,
    total_received = total_received + 10,
    last_received_date = NOW(),
    last_received_quantity = 10
WHERE retailer_id = 'Mahesh Enterprises'
  AND sku_code = 'FGCMGM0092-250';

-- Sanal Enterprises
UPDATE retailer_inventory
SET current_stock = current_stock + 7,
    total_received = total_received + 7,
    last_received_date = NOW(),
    last_received_quantity = 7
WHERE retailer_id = 'Sanal Enterprises'
  AND sku_code = 'FGCMGM0092-250';
```

### Viewing Retailer Stock

MDO can later visit Mahesh Enterprises and:
1. Click link to view inventory
2. See current stock: 10 units of Agrosatva 250ml
3. View transfer history showing when and from whom stock was received
4. GPS coordinates prove the transfer was recorded at the right location

## Security & Data Integrity

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- All authenticated users can read transfers and inventory
- Only authenticated users can create transfers
- Transfers are immutable (no updates/deletes allowed)
- Inventory can be updated by authenticated users

### Audit Trail
Every transfer records:
- Exact date/time
- GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- Who recorded it (user email)
- Complete product/SKU details
- Quantities and values

### Data Validation
- Stock quantities must be positive
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate inventory records
- Transfer types are constrained to valid values
- Retailer inventory cannot go negative

## Benefits

1. **Complete Traceability:** Every unit of stock movement is tracked
2. **Accurate Inventory:** Retailers have real-time stock visibility
3. **Audit Compliance:** Full history with GPS verification
4. **Business Intelligence:** Can analyze distribution patterns
5. **Dispute Resolution:** Clear records of all transfers
6. **Performance Tracking:** Monitor distributor-retailer transactions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Retailer Sales Tracking:** When retailers sell to farmers
2. **Stock Reconciliation:** Compare physical vs. system stock
3. **Alerts:** Notify when retailer stock is low
4. **Analytics Dashboard:** Visualize supply chain flow
5. **Mobile App Integration:** QR code scanning for transfers
6. **Batch Transfers:** Transfer multiple SKUs at once

## Migration Instructions

   ```bash
   # The migration file is in:
