### Issue: "Mobile App" link not visible in sidebar

2. Sidebar is collapsed (click menu icon to expand)
3. Browser zoom is too high (reset zoom to 100%)

**Solution:**

- Look for the üì± Smartphone icon in sidebar
- Or use direct URL: `/mobile`

**Solution:**
```

2. Clear localStorage: localStorage.clear()
3. Refresh and login again
4. Try different browser
```

### Issue: "Layout component is blocking mobile view"

The mobile app route is currently inside the Layout wrapper. This means:
- ‚úÖ You see the desktop sidebar on the left
- ‚úÖ Mobile app interface on the right/center
- ‚úÖ This is intentional for easy role switching

**To test pure mobile experience:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Click the device toolbar icon (or Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Select a mobile device (iPhone, Android, etc.)
4. Refresh the page
